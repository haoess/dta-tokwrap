    present on the build system. Then, follow the instructions in "Building
    from Source".

  Building from Source
    To build and install the entire package, issue the following commands to
    the shell:

     bash$ cd dta-tokwrap-0.01   # (or wherever you unpacked this distribution)
     bash$ sh ./configure        # configure the package
     bash$ make                  # build the package
     bash$ make install          # install the package on your system

    More details on the top-level installation process can be found in the
    file INSTALL in the distribution root directory.

    More details on building and installing the DTA::TokWrap perl module
    included in this distribution can be found in the perlmodinstall(1)
    manpage.

USAGE
    The perl program dta-tokwrap.perl installed from the DTA-TokWrap/
    distribution subdirectory provides a flexible high-level command-line
    interface to the tokenization of DTA XML documents.

  Input Format
    The dta-tokwrap.perl script takes as its input DTA "base-format" XML
    files, which are simply (TEI-conformant) UTF-8 encoded XML files with
    one "<c>" element per character:

    *   the document MUST be encoded in UTF-8,

    *   all text nodes to be tokenized should be descendants of a "<text>"
        element, and may optionally be immediate daughters of a "<c>"
        element (XPath "//text//text()|//text//c/text()"). "<c>" elements
        may not be nested.

        Prior to dta-tokwrap v0.38, "<c>" elements were required.

  Example: Tokenizing a single XML file
    Assume we wish to tokenize a single DTA "base-format" XML file doc1.xml.
    Issue the following command to the shell:

     bash$ dta-tokwrap.perl doc1.xml

    ... This will create the following output files:

    doc1.t.xml
        "Master" tokenizer output file encoding sentence boundaries, token
        boundaries, and tokenizer-provided token analyses. Source for
        various stand-off annotation formats. This format can also be passed
        directly to and from the DTA::CAB(3pm) analysis suite using the
        DTA::CAB::Format::XmlNative(3pm) formatter class.

  Example: Tokenizing multiple XML files
    Assume we wish to tokenize a corpus of three DTA "base-format" XML files
    doc1.xml, doc2.xml, and doc3.xml. This is as easy as:

     bash$ dta-tokwrap.perl doc1.xml doc2.xml doc3.xml

    For each input document specified on the command line, master output
    files and stand-off annotation files will be created.

    See "the dta-tokwrap.perl manpage" for more details.

  Example: Tracing execution progess
    Assume we wish to tokenize a large corpus of XML input files doc*.xml,
    and would like to have some feedback on the progress of the tokenization
    process. Try:

     bash$ dta-tokwrap.perl -verbose=1 doc*.xml

    or:

     bash$ dta-tokwrap.perl -verbose=2 doc*.xml

    or even:

     bash$ dta-tokwrap.perl -traceAll doc*.xml

TOOLS
    This section provides a brief overview of the individual tools included
    in the dta-tokwrap distribution.

  Perl Scripts & Programs
    The perl scripts and programs included with this distribution are
    installed by default in /usr/local/bin and/or wherever your perl
    installs scripts by default (e.g. in `perl -MConfig -e 'print
    $Config{installsitescript}'`).

    dta-tokwrap.perl
        Top-level wrapper script for document tokenization using the
        DTA::TokWrap perl API.

    dtatw-add-c.perl
        Script to insert "<c>" elements and/or "xml:id" attributes for such
        elements into an XML document which does not yet contain them.
        Guaranteed not to clobber any existing //c IDs.

        //c/@xml:id attributes are generated by a simple document-global
        counter ("c1", "c2", ..., "c65536").

        See "the dtatw-add-c.perl manpage" for more details.

    dtatw-cids2local.perl
        Script to convert "//c/@xml:id" attributes to page-local encoding.
        Never really used.

        See "the dtatw-cids2local.perl manpage" for more details.

    dtatw-add-ws.perl
        Script to splice "<s>" and "<w>" elements encoded from a standoff
        (.t.xml or .u.xml) XML file into the *original* "base-format"
        (.chr.xml) file, producing a .cws.xml file. A tad too generous with
        partial word segments, due to strict adjacency and boundary
        criteria.

        In earlier versions of dta-tokwrap, this functionality was split
        between the scripts "dtatw-add-w.perl" and "dtatw-add-s.perl", which
        required only an *id-compatible* base-format (.chr.xml) file as the
        splice target. As of dta-tokwrap v0.35, the splice target
        base-format file must be *original* source file itself, since the
        current implementation uses byte offsets to perform the splice.

        See "the dtatw-add-ws.perl manpage" for more details.

    dtatw-splice.perl
        Script to splice generic standoff attributes and/or content into a
        base file; useful e.g. for merging flat DTA::CAB standoff analyses
        into TEI-structured *.cws.xml files.

        See "the dtatw-splice.perl manpage" for more details.

    dtatw-get-ddc-attrs.perl
        Script to insert DDC-relevant attributes extracted from a base file
        into a *.t.xml file, producing a pre-DDC XML format file (by
        convention *.ddc.t.xml, a subset of the *.t.xml format).

        See "the dtatw-get-ddc-attrs.perl manpage" for more details.

    dtatw-get-header.perl
        Simple script to extract a single header element from an XML file
        (e.g. for later inclusion in a DDC XML format file).

        See "the dtatw-get-header.perl manpage" for more details.

        See "the dtatw-get-header.perl manpage" for more details.

    dtatw-pn2p.perl
        Script to conver insert <p>...</p> wrappers for "//s/@pn" key
        attributes in "flat" *.t.xml files.

    dtatw-xml2ddc.perl
        Script to convert *.ddc.t.xml files and optional headers to DDC-XML
        format.

        See "the dtatw-xml2ddc.perl manpage" for more details.

    dtatw-t-check.perl
        Simple script to check consistency of tokenizer output (*.t) offset
        + length fields with input (*.txt) file.

    dtatw-add-c.perl
        Script to add "<c>" elements to an XML document which does not
        already contain them. Not really useful as of dta-tokwrap v0.38.

    dtatw-rm-c.perl
        Script to remove "<c>" elements from an XML document. Regex hack,
        fast but not exceedingly robust, use with caution. See also
        "dtatw-rm-c.xsl"

    dtatw-rm-w.perl
        Fast regex hack to remove "<w>" elements from an XML document

    dtatw-rm-s.perl
        Fast regex hack to remove "<s>" elements from an XML document.

    dtatw-rm-lb.perl
        Script to remove "<lb>" (line-break) elements from an XML document,
        replacing them with newlines. Regex hack, fast but not robust, use
        with caution. See also "dtatw-rm-lb.xsl"

    dtatw-tt-dictapply.perl
        Script to apply a type-"dictionary" in one-word-per-line (.tt)
        format to a token corpus in one-word-per-line (.tt) format.
        Especially useful together with standard UNIX utilities such as cut,
        grep, sort, and uniq.

    dtatw-cabtt2xml.perl
        Script to convert DTA::CAB::Format::TT (one-word-per-line with
        variable analysis fields identified by conventional prefixes) files
        to expanded .t.xml format used by dta-tokwrap. The expanded format
        should be identical to that used by the DTA::CAB::Format::Xml class.
        See also dtatw-txml2tt.xsl.

    file-substr.perl
        Script to extract a portion of a file, specified by byte offset and
        length. Useful for debugging index files created by other tools.

  GNU make build system template
    The distribution directory make/ contains a "template" for using GNU
    make to organizing the conversion of large corpora with the dta-tokwrap
    utilities. This is useful because:

    *   make's intuitive, easy-to-read syntax provides a wonderful vehicle
        for user-defined configuration files, obviating the need to remember
        the names of all 64 (at last count)
        "dta-tokwrap.perl|/dta-tokwrap.perl" options,

    *   make is very good at tracking complex dependencies of the sort that
        exist between the various temporary files generated by the
        dta-tokwrap utilities,

    *   make jobs can be made "robust" simply by adding a "-k"
        ("--keep-going") to the command-line, and

    *   last but certainly not least, make has built-in support for
        parallelization of complex tasks by means of the "-j N" ("--jobs=N")
        option, allowing us to take advantage of multiprocessor systems.

    By default, the contents of the distribution make/ subdirectory are
    installed to /usr/local/share/dta-tokwrap/make/. See the comments at the
    top of make/User.mak for instructions.

  Perl Modules
    DTA::TokWrap
        Top-level tokenization-wrapper module, used by dta-tokwrap.perl.

    DTA::TokWrap::Document
        Object-oriented wrapper for documents to be processed.

    DTA::TokWrap::Processor
        Abstract base class for elementary document-processing operations.

    See the DTA::TokWrap::Intro(3pm) manpage for more details on included
    modules, APIs, calling conventions, etc.

  XSL stylesheets
    The XSL stylesheets included with this distribution are installed by
    default in /usr/local/share/dta-tokwrap/stylesheets.

    dtatw-add-lb.xsl
        Replaces newlines with "<lb/>" elements in input document.

    dtatw-assign-cids.xsl
        Assigns missing "//c/@xml:id" attributes using the XSL
        "generate-id()" function.

    dtatw-rm-c.xsl
        Removes "<c>" elements from the input document. Slow but robust.

    dtatw-rm-lb.xsl
        Replaces "<lb/>" elements with newlines.

    dtatw-txml2tt.xsl
        Converts "master" tokenized XML output format (*.t.xml) to
        TAB-separated one-word-per-line format (*.mr.t aka *.t aka *.tt aka
        "tt" aka "CSV" aka DTA::CAB::Format::TT aka "TnT" aka "TreeTagger"
        aka "vertical" aka "moot-native" aka ...). See the mootfiles(5)
        manpage for basic format details, and see the top of the XSL script
        for some influential transformation parameters.

  C Programs
    Several C programs are included with the distribution. These are used by
    the dta-tokwrap.perl script to perform various intermediate document
    processing operations, and should not need to be called by the user
    directly.

    Caveat Scriptor: The following programs are meant for internal use by
    the "DTA::TokWrap" modules only, and their names, calling conventions,
    and very presence is subject to change without notice.

    dtatw-mkindex
        Splits input document doc.xml into a "character index" doc.cx (CSV),
        a "structural index" doc.sx (XML), and a "text index" doc.tx (UTF-8
        text).

    dtatw-rm-namespaces
        Removes namespaces from any XML document by renaming ""xmlns""
        attributes to ""xmlns_"" and ""xmlns:*"" attributes to ""xmlns_*"".
        Useful because XSL's namespace handling is annoyingly slow and ugly.

    dtatw-tokenize-dummy
        Dummy "flex" tokenizer. Useful for testing.

    dtatw-txml2sxml
        Converts "master" tokenized XML output format (*.t.xml) to
        sentence-level stand-off XML format (*.s.xml).

    dtatw-txml2wxml
        Converts "master" tokenized XML output format (*.t.xml) to
        token-level stand-off XML format (*.w.xml).

    dtatw-txml2axml
        Converts "master" tokenized XML output format (*.t.xml) to
        token-analysis-level stand-off XML format (*.a.xml).
